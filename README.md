# Send request to the API

1. Install [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
2. Save this [file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/HashTucE/8f89d2baff367100c6b5cbf59480e3c7/raw/f9452eab9d4b09de2478d7ea8e5d4e07692b0bff/P5%2520Endpoints.json) as `collection1.json`
3. Save this other [file](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/HashTucE/d271db756bfbaf22fc3cae7d5522454a/raw/37ff884dc32be35e9ef63f31bd6c44bbd1e204fb/P5%2520URLs.json) as `collection2.json`
3. Import both HTTP request collections into `Postman`

Now you should be able to access to 2 differents collections :
- P5 Endpoints will give you the possibility to create, update or delete a person, a medical record or a firestation. Check the body section before sending the request.
- P5 URLs will give you the possibility to get the following information depending on the params section :
    - The list of all inhabitants covered by a fire station
    - The list and the number of children of a given address
    - The list of telephone numbers of the inhabitants covered by a fire station
    - The list of all inhabitants sorted by household
    - The list of all inhabitants sorted by fire station
    - The personal information of a resident
    - The list of emails of all the inhabitants of a city
